Instructions:
Once you have a team, you will brainstorm on an idea that involves generating structured or unstructured text using an LLM. 
Try out your idea on 383GPT to get a sense of what is possible. 
Include your findings in your project proposal where you indicate the models capabilties on a single prompt. 
You are free to choose the discipline, it can be science, poetry, literature, language etc. 
Write a draft of the idea, providing details on the problem, the dataset that you will use and how you will evaluate the performance of the LLM. 
Submit a draft on gradescope, a course staff will be assigned to mentor you during the 8 weeks of the project.

Examples:
- Generating SQL code from python panda code
- Generating sentences that rhyme but limited to a specific topic
- Generating a score for CVs given a job description
- Generating a summary of a 383 lecture
